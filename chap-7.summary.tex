\section{Summary of results}
The study on mutant programs of the case study has revealed the following results:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Reliability estimates based on number of bugs present in the software is likely to be inaccurate for safety-critical software.
\item Safety-critical software should not show any warnings or errors during dynamic analysis. In the present study, it was found that: the average warnings/errors observed during dynamic analysis decreases exponentially as the reliability increases.
\item However, no conclusive relationship was found between software reliability and warnings observed during static analysis.
\item For safety-critical software, the required safety can be achieved by improving the reliability; however vice-versa is not always true.

\end{enumerate}
